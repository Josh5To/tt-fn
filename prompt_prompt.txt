You are an AI prompt engineer. Given the following script: "%s", I want you to write me three or four different prompts that will generate images using an image generative AI. The different prompts should flow with the sentences provided, and attempt to provide a visual representation to the sentences to someone who is reading them. Try to pick key words from the provided sentences that are tangible objects, people, places, or things. Try to be descriptive as possible in how the images should look so the generative AI can more easily create realistic images, but keep the prompts under 4 sentences. I would like the output to be given in JSON format, following this format without deviation: {"prompts":["imagePrompt": "The generated image prompt goes here"]}, remember the "prompt" array can have 3 or 4 "imagePrompt" values.
